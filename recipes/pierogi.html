    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Pierogi</strong> are filled dumplings, made by wrapping unleavened dough around a filling, and occasionally flavored with a savory or sweet garnish, finally cooked in boiling water.</p> 
    <p>Typical fillings include potato, cheese, quark, sauerkraut, ground meat, mushrooms, fruits, and/or berries. Savory pierogi are often served with a topping of sour cream, fried onions, or both.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g of wheat flour, e.g. type 500</li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of oil - 50 ml</li>
        <li>A cup of hot water - 250 ml</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add flour and salt to a mixer bowl, mix.</li>
        <li>In a small pot, heat water with butter/oil until it's very warm/hot, but not boiling yet. Add the hot water to the bowl with flour.</li>
        <li>Stir with a spoon until the ingredients are roughly combined.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough by hand or with a stand mixer using a hook attachment. The dough should be well kneaded, soft, and smooth (it will become even softer after resting). Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the filling (in the photo, the filling is for pierogi ruskie).</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into two parts. Roll out the first part on a lightly floured surface (I like silicone rolling mats). Cut out circles.</li>
        <li>Place the filling on each cut-out circle (you can either form small balls of filling or simply scoop it with a teaspoon).</li>
        <li>Seal the edges of the dough. It is important to seal the edges well, otherwise, the pierogi may open during cooking.</li>
        <li>Cooking the pierogi: Boil the pierogi in a large pot of salted water over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook the pierogi for 1-2 minutes after they float to the surface of the water.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pot with a slotted spoon, drain well, and transfer to a plate.</li>
    </ol>
